 You will occasionally see dates shown in the margin (for example, next to this
 paragraph!) \announce{2017-06-25}{announce} which detail the date of the version in
 which the feature was implemented; the `N' stands for `new as of the date shown' and `U'
 stands for `updated as of the date shown'. If you see \stardemo, it means that the
 feature is either new (N) or updated (U) as of the release of the current version; if
 you see \stardemo\, attached to a listing, then it means that listing is new (N) or
 updated (U) as of the current version. If you have not read this document before (and
 even if you have!), then you can ignore every occurrence of the \stardemo; they are
 simply there to highlight new and updated features. The new and updated features in this
 documentation (\gitRel) are on the following pages: \listOfNewFeatures% % \end{latexonly}
